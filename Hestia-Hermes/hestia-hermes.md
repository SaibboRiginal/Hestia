# Hestia-Hermes 📨

**Role:** Generic Proactive Dispatch Core
**Node:** Raspberry Pi (Always-On)
**Stack:** Python · FastAPI · Docker

---

## Responsibility

Hermes receives generic domain events, matches them against active subscriptions, and dispatches alerts via configured channels.

Hermes is core and generic: no domain-specific rules are implemented in Hermes.

---

## Event Flow

1. Domain module emits event (example: `entity.upserted`).
2. Hermes loads active subscriptions from Archive.
3. Hermes performs generic matching + dedupe checks.
4. Hermes dispatches alert via channel adapter.
5. Hermes writes delivery outcome to Archive dispatch log.

---

## API (MVP)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/events/ingest` | Ingest one event and evaluate subscriptions |
| `POST` | `/api/dispatch/send` | Direct dispatch command (internal use) |
| `GET` | `/health` | Hermes health |

---

## Constraints

- No domain-specific ranking logic.
- No DB access outside Archive APIs.
- No chat orchestration (Oracle responsibility).
- No connector/data-fetching logic (Hecate/module responsibility).


## Documentation Synchronization (Required)

1. Any behavior, command, or contract change must update this service document in the same change set.
2. If API routes, methods, schemas, or Hub-routed command contracts change, update Hestia-Swagger/swagger.yml in the same change.
3. Ensure command metadata exposed to Hub discovery is complete and accurate (service, method, path, arguments/templates) so Oracle and clients can execute deterministically.
4. Keep canonical payloads rich at source; client-facing detail level is controlled by client rendering policy (minimal/compact/rich), not by deleting upstream semantics.
